## ‚ú® Overview

`auto-logs` is a lightweight, self-contained utility designed to provide a continuous, version-controlled heartbeat for your background processes, scheduled tasks, or even just your development environment.

It operates on a simple principle: **regularly commit the current date and time to a dedicated `auto-logs.txt` file within your repository.**

## ü§î Why `auto-logs`?

In many scenarios, you have critical background processes (like cron jobs, data sync scripts, or long-running services) that operate quietly without generating extensive, complex logs that need external monitoring tools. `auto-logs` fills this gap by offering a **minimalist, git-native audit trail** of their regular execution.

*   **System Heartbeat:** Provides a clear, visible signal that a scheduled task or process is indeed running at its expected intervals. A quick glance at the `auto-logs.txt` file's commit history on GitHub tells you if your daily/hourly task successfully executed.
*   **Low-Overhead Audit Trail:** Avoids generating large log files for simple "proof of life" scenarios. The commit history itself *is* the log.
*   **Version-Controlled Activity:** All entries are stored directly in your Git repository, ensuring an immutable history that's easily browsable and accessible to anyone with repository access.
*   **Developer Dashboard:** For personal projects, it can subtly indicate consistent progress or active maintenance, even if no other major code changes are occurring. It's a "proof of life" for your repo.
*   **Debugging & Verification:** If a scheduled task fails, the absence of a recent date entry in `auto-logs.txt` (or a corresponding commit) can be an immediate indicator of a problem, guiding you to investigate.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Automatic Date/Time Logging:** Appends the current timestamp to `auto-logs.txt`.
*   **Git Integration:** Automatically stages, commits, and pushes the updated file.
*   **Minimal Footprint:** Designed to be extremely lightweight and resource-efficient.
*   **Configurable:** Easily adjust the target file, commit message, and execution frequency (via external scheduler).

## ü§ù Contributing

While `auto-logs` is simple by design, contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, better ways to handle Git operations, or wish to add more sophisticated logging options (while maintaining the core philosophy of lightweight, visible heartbeats), feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
